    <!-- So we have seen the use of <p> tag and how can we use to write multi-line paragraph-->
        <!-- But if we use <p> tag with new line ie somthing like below -->
        <p>Hello ,this is the very first line
           this another line ,
           this is yet another line 
        </p>
        <!-- So this is another line ,and this is yet another line are on two different line
        but it wont be shown in html page on two different line cause html <p> dont have text
        formatting like adding new line or space more than required -->
        <!-- So for new line we can use <br> tag -->

        <p>This is first line ,<br>
           this is another line 
        </p>

        <!-- or we can use pre tag which have new line and space text formatting-->
<pre>
First Line,
Second Line,
Third Line
</pre>

<!-- In pre tag start from the very beginning of html page wwithout indentation
cause it will format the extra space also -->
