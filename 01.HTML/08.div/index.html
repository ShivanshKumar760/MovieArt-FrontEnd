    <!-- Div is a generic tag 
    
        The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

        The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

        The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

        Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag! 

        div is a invisible container which is used to store other HTML elements

    <div style="background-color: red;">

    <div>
        <h1>This is the heading for div 2</h1>
        <p>This is a div <b>2</b></p>
