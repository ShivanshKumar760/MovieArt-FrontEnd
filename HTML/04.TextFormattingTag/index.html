    <!-- In html we have some text formating tag like bolding a text or making it italic-->
    <!--For bolding a text we have two tag 1.<b>--bold tag and <strong>--provide more emphasis on bolding the tag -->
        <p>this is a normal text</p>
        <b>This is a bold text</b>
        <strong>This is a strong text</strong>
        <!-- Now both strong and b tag are inline tag
        which means they only take the required amount
        of space needed by the text and not the whole line  -->

        <!-- So to make the strong text come on new line 
        we can use br tag -->
        <br>
        <b>This is a bold text 2</b>
        <br>
        <strong>This is a strong text 2</strong>

        <!-- Now we can also make our tag italic using
        <i> tag and <em> emphasis tag -->
        <br>
        <i>Hello</i>
        <br>
        <em>This is also hello</em>
        <!-- We can also higlight the text using mark tag -->
        <br>
        <mark>this is a mark element</mark>

        <!-- We can strike a text so that people wont do it
        or read it -->
        <br>
        <del>This is a deleted text</del>

    <!--We can also underline the text using <u> tag and <inserted>tag  -->
        <br>
        <u>This is a underline text</u>
        <br>
        <ins>This is a inserted tag</ins>

        <!-- We can make a text small using <small> text-->
        <br>
        <small>This is a small text</small>

        <!-- We can have a subscript using <sub> tag -->

        <br>
        O<sub>2</sub>
        <br>
        <!--Similarly we have super script -->
